Question 4.
A density that looks like a normal density (but may or may not be exactly normal) is exactly symmetric about zero. (Symmetric means if you flip it around zero it looks the same.) What is its median? 
-> The median must be 0 since 50 percent of the mass is below 0 and 50% is above

Question 6.
A web site (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band64/b64-7.html) for home pregnancy tests cites the following: “When the subjects using the test were women who collected and tested their own samples, the overall sensitivity was 75%. Specificity was also low, in the range 52% to 75%.” Assume the lower value for the specificity. Suppose a subject has a positive test and that 30% of women taking pregnancy tests are actually pregnant. What number is closest to the probability of pregnancy given the positive test?
-> P(Preg|+)=P(+|Preg)P(Preg)P(+|Preg)P(Preg)+P(+|Pregc)P(Pregc)=.75×.30.75×.30+(1−.52)×(1−.3)≈0.40

The prevalance of pregnancy in the population is 30%

$P(pregnant) = 0.30$

$P(pregnant^c) = 1 - P(pregnant) = 0.70$

The sensitivity is 75%, eg. the probablility of a positive test when pregnant

$P(+:\vert:pregnant) = 0.75$

The specificity is 52%, eg. the probablility of a negative test when not pregnant

$P(-:\vert:pregnant^c) = 0.52$

$P(+:\vert:pregnant^c) = 1 - P(-:\vert:pregnant^c) = 0.48$
